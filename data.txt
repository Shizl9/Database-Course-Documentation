1- Comparison: Flat File Systems vs Relational Databases
| Feature             | Flat File Systems                                                           | Relational Databases                                                        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**       | Data stored in a single file (e.g., CSV, TXT).                              | Data stored in tables with rows and columns, linked by keys.                |
| **Data Redundancy** | High redundancy as similar data may be repeated in multiple files.          | Low redundancy due to normalization and relational structure.               |
| **Relationships**   | No formal relationships; connections between data must be handled manually. | Supports relationships using primary keys, foreign keys, and joins.         |
| **Example Usage**   | Simple address books, CSV logs, small-scale apps.                           | Banking systems, e-commerce platforms, hospital management systems.         |
| **Drawbacks**       | Difficult to maintain, error-prone, poor scalability.                       | Requires more setup and design knowledge, slightly more complex management. |
