1- Comparison: Flat File Systems vs Relational Databases
| Feature             | Flat File Systems                                                           | Relational Databases                                                        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**       | Data stored in a single file (e.g., CSV, TXT).                              | Data stored in tables with rows and columns, linked by keys.                |
| **Data Redundancy** | High redundancy as similar data may be repeated in multiple files.          | Low redundancy due to normalization and relational structure.               |
| **Relationships**   | No formal relationships; connections between data must be handled manually. | Supports relationships using primary keys, foreign keys, and joins.         |
| **Example Usage**   | Simple address books, CSV logs, small-scale apps.                           | Banking systems, e-commerce platforms, hospital management systems.         |
| **Drawbacks**       | Difficult to maintain, error-prone, poor scalability.                       | Requires more setup and design knowledge, slightly more complex management. |


Q3
Roles in a Database System

System Analyst – Analyzes business requirements and recommends database solutions.

Database Designer – Designs the logical and physical database schema.

Database Developer – Implements database structures, queries, and stored procedures.

DBA (Database Administrator) – Maintains database performance, security, and backups.

Application Developer – Develops software applications that interact with the database.

BI Developer (Business Intelligence) – Creates reports and dashboards from database data for decision-making.



Additional Research Topics
Types of Databases

Relational vs Non-Relational

Relational – Uses tables and SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

Non-Relational – Uses document, key-value, or graph models (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).

Centralized vs Distributed vs Cloud Databases

Centralized – Stored on a single server.

Distributed – Data spread across multiple servers for redundancy and performance.

Cloud Databases – Hosted in the cloud, scalable, and accessible globally (e.g., Azure SQL, Amazon RDS).

Cloud Storage and Databases

Definition: Cloud storage stores data on remote servers, accessible via the internet.

Advantages: Scalability, accessibility, reduced hardware costs.

Disadvantages: Dependency on internet, potential security/privacy concerns.

Database Engines and Languages

Database Engine: Software that handles database storage, retrieval, and management.

Examples: SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL.

Languages: T-SQL (SQL Server), PL/SQL (Oracle), ANSI SQL (standard across engines).

Notes: Some languages are engine-specific, but ANSI SQL can work across multiple engines.

Database Migration Between Engines

Possible: Yes, but requires careful planning.

Challenges: Differences in data types, stored procedures, triggers, indexing.

Considerations: Ensure compatibility, adjust scripts, validate data integrity.

Logical vs Physical Schema

Logical Schema: Abstract design showing entities, attributes, and relationships (e.g., Student {ID, Name, Age}).

Physical Schema: Actual storage structure in the database (tables, columns, data types).

Difference: Logical focuses on business view; physical focuses on storage implementation.

Example:

Logical Schema:

Student (StudentID, StudentName, Age)


Physical Schema:

CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Age INT
);
